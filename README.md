===================================================

How does the game work?
-->	 A random word is generated by the game.
-->	 A-Z word buttons are provided which are used to guess the word.
-->	 You need to fill up the blank spaces with the correct letter.
-->	 For each incorrect guess a part of the man will be hung.
-->	 You get about 9 tries to find the word. If you cross the limit, the character is hung and you lose the game and the actual word will be displayed.
